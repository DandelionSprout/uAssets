How to run this script locally:

1) Download **legacyJSconverter.py**.
2) Run it in Python.
3) Upload the resulting **legacyJS.notlist** to this folder.
4) (Not always necessary:) If any metadata or non-JS entries needs to be changed, do this to **NotAuto.notlist**. If anything is changed, upload that file to this folder.
5) Run the script once more, once you've ensured that the changes to **legacyJS.notlist** and **NotAuto.notlist** have gone live in their raw versions.
6) Upload the resulting **legacy.txt** to the https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/tree/master/filters folder.
